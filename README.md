This project developed a machine learning model for engagement level detection, achieving a 0.9 F1 score in non-engagement identification. Utilizing Google MediaPipe for feature extraction and XGBoost for training on the DAiSEE dataset, the system accurately classified engagement states. This represents a significant advancement in mind-wandering detection and real-time engagement analysis.
