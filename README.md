This project developed a machine learning model to detect engagement levels, achieving a remarkable 0.9 F1 score in identifying non-engagement. Leveraging Google MediaPipe for feature extraction and XGBoost for model training on the DAiSEE dataset, the system accurately classified engagement states, demonstrating the effectiveness of this approach for real-time engagement analysis.
